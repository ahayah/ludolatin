[LudoLatin](https://www.ludolatin.com) is an open-source project to make learning a language free, fun and fast. The official implementation aims to teach Latin, but it is built flexibly enough that any language could be taught, by simply writing yml lesson data to the `data` directory.

LudoLatin is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can use it on [the website](https://www.ludolatin.com).

The [`ludolatin`](https://github.com/ludolatin/ludolatin) repository is where I do development and there are many ways you can participate in the project, for example:

* [Submit bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/ludolatin/ludolatin/issues) and help verify as they are checked in
* Review [source code changes](https://github.com/ludolatin/ludolatin/pulls)

## Install
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) provides a local install of python, pip, and any installed extensions.
If virtualenv isn't already installed, you may need a user with admin privelidges to install it:

```
[sudo] pip install virtualenv
```

Now clone this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/merelinguist/ludolatin.git
cd ludolatin
```

To create and use a virtual environment in the project directory:

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the project requirements in the created `venv` directory:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Flask requires that an environment variable is set to identify the file to run,
and optionally another to enable debugging output:

```
export FLASK_APP=ludolatin.py
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

You can see your configured environment variables with:

```
env
```

You will need to activate venv and set up the environment variables every time you open a new shell.
As a shortcut you can run the following:

```
source setup
```

In production you also need to create the following environment variables: 
```
FLASK_ENV=production
DATABASE_USERNAME='<someone>',
DATABASE_PASSWORD='<something>'

```


## Database

You'll need a MySQL database. (Other databases will work with some minor code changes 
(specifically the GROUP BY date SQL queries), but sqlite is not so good with migrations.)

### Database configuration
If you are using mysql 5.7.5 or above, you will need to add a line to your `my.cnf` config file to remove
`ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY`:

```
sql_mode = "STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,NO_ZERO_DATE,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION"
```

If you don't know where that file is, run: 
```
mysqld --verbose --help | grep -A 1 "Default options"
```

then check each location in turn.

The error that you'll see without this is:
```
sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError
ProgrammingError: (mysql.connector.errors.ProgrammingError) 1055 (42000): Expression #1 of ORDER BY clause is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'ingenuity_dev.score.created_at' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by [SQL: u'SELECT sum(score.score) AS sum_1 \nFROM score \nWHERE %(param_1)s = score.user_id GROUP BY date_format(score.created_at, %(date_format_1)s) ORDER BY score.created_at DESC \n LIMIT %(param_2)s'] [parameters: {u'date_format_1': '%Y-%m-%d', u'param_1': 18, u'param_2': 7}]
```

To run mysql without starting it at boot, run:
```
mysql.server start
```

### Database creation

Now that the database is installed and configured, create a database:

```
mysql -u root -e "CREATE DATABASE ludolatin_dev"
```

Finally, create the migrations and initialise the database with:

```
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```


## Run

To run the app:

```
flask run
```

Or, to make the server available to other devices:

```
flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```

You will now find the server running on: `http://localhost:5000`, or for other devices, http://<your_local_ip>:5000

You can also browse the API at: `http://localhost:5000/api/` (Note, most of the API is unused.)

To add an admin user, load data, etc. use:

```
python manage.py <command>
```

For a full list of commands type:

```
python manage.py
```
